## ⚙️ How It Works

There are two main ways to access the item spawner:

### ✅ **Trainer-Based Spawner:**

* Launch trainer before the game
* In-game overlay shows a list of all items
* Use dropdown menus or hotkeys to spawn
* Stack amounts can be selected (e.g., 1, 10, 100 logs)

### ✅ **Console Command Unlocker:**

* Enable developer mode or console (via config edits or mods)
* Use in-game command like:
  `additem [item name] [amount]`
  e.g., `additem ModernAxe 1`

Trainer-based spawners are smoother, don’t require code typing, and often come with filters and search bars for fast item lookup.
